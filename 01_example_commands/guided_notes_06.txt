 # SQL COMMAND PROMPT GUIDED NOTES

# ---------------- Exercise 6 ------------------- #
#
#  Create table with NOT NULL keys
#
# ---------------------

# In the previous table intialization (repeated in the line below), s_name IS allowed to be NULL (by default)
CREATE TABLE students(id INT, s_name VARCHAR(100), PRIMARY KEY(id))

# this allows us to add students with or without names
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (1, 'larry');
INSERT INTO students(id) VALUE (2) 

# here - you can see that student 2 does not have a name.
#  this can be annoying if you actually want him or her to have a name!
SELECT * FROM students;

# SO - let's get rid of this table and make one with NOT NULL s_name
DROP TABLE students;
CREATE TABLE students(id INT, s_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id))

# when we try to add a student without a name this time, we get an error
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (1, 'larry');
INSERT INTO students(id) VALUE (2) 

DROP TABLE students;
