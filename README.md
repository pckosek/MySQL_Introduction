# An Introduction to MySQL

The goal of this repository is to provide a set of resources that can get you up and running with MySQL.

### Recommended First Steps:

- **Set up a MySQL Database** - instructions on how to do this on Director are  [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUMw_jnk5sw)
- **Familiarize yourself with SQL** - CodeAcademy has a great series for this under the title [Learn Sql](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql#)
- **Know where the docs live** - MySQL is well documented. [The docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/)
- **Be Aware of a Good Helper** - I like [mysqltutorial.org](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/). Note that this page looks very similar to sqlservertutorial.net - __but sqlserver is not the same thing as mysql__. 
- **Setup a local installation of MySQL (mariadb) on your Windows computer** - video instructions on how to do this on any windows computer are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rSbWRpzQtg)
