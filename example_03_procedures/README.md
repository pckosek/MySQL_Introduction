## This example shows how to run a sql script.

This will allow you to 'prewrite' sql procedures. The procedure is a sql function that exists on the server

Here's the process:
* place the .sql file in a folder on your server
* navigate to the sql command prompt and type the command:
  * `SOURCE /the/full/file/path/with/slashes/proc_1.sql`

the above script will initialize the procedures defined in the file. Once that initialization script has been run,  you can run a command like<br>
`CALL simple_proc;`<br>
OR<br>
`CALL less_simple_proc('VA');`<br>
 to see all your sql wonderfulness!
