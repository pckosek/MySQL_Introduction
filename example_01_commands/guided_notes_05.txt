#
#  Create table with PRIMARY KEYS
#
# ---------------------

# construct our table this time with the same two parameters,
# 	id (an int) and s_name (a varchar), but this time specify
#   that id is the primary key
#	- A PRIMARY KEY is a specification that the indicated column
#     MUST be unique and CANNOT be NULL
CREATE TABLE students(id INT, s_name VARCHAR(100), PRIMARY KEY(id))

# add bob again
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (1, 'bob');

# what what happens when you try to add larry with bob's key!
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (1, 'larry');

# clearly larry wasn't added.
SELECT * FROM students;

# also, watch what happens when we try tio insert larry without a key.
# (it fails)
INSERT INTO students(s_name) VALUE ('larry');

SELECT * FROM students;

DROP TABLE students;
