 # SQL COMMAND PROMPT GUIDED NOTES

# ---------------- Exercise 4 ------------------- #
#
#  CAUTION - inserted elements are just rows and not unique by default!
#
# ---------------------

# Create table as before
CREATE TABLE students(id INT, s_name VARCHAR(100));

# add three students into this table
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (1, 'bob');
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (2, 'paul');
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (1, 'frank');
INSERT INTO students(id, s_name) VALUE (2, 'frank');

# look at the table now
#  - note that the insert command is just adding additional rows
SELECT * FROM students;

# This table structure can be a problem if you wanted to select 
#   a student by their student id
#  - notice that multiple ids are returned in each of these queries
SELECT s_name FROM students WHERE id = 1;
SELECT id FROM students WHERE s_name = 'frank';

DROP TABLE students;
